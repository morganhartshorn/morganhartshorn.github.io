  <p>I am a young professional going into my final year studying <strong>Business and Enterprise Management</strong>. One of my strengths, and what makes me unique, comes from my background, which gives me a different angle through which I view the world of business.</p>

  <p>We live in a world where revenues and cash flows are the ultimate indicators of success and failure — with the foundation of this success coming from understanding society and what motivates the customer to spend their hard-earned cash. Subsequent failure to effectively capitalise on these behavioural insights is the barrier preventing many SMEs from developing into market leaders.</p>

  <p>Before I enrolled in my degree, I studied <strong>Psychology</strong> and <strong>Sociology</strong>. This helped equip me with a deeper insight into human behaviour and how consumer preferences have been conditioned into people. This formed a better understanding of how I can help capitalise on these preferences and tackle real-world business challenges.</p>

  <p>At this stage in my journey, I am working hard to develop my skillset through extra-curricular activities such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Completing an <strong>Email Marketing course</strong></li>
    <li>Learning <strong>Mandarin</strong> — with China being one of the world's largest consumer markets and suppliers</li>
    <li><strong>Networking</strong> — forming connections and learning from those with industry experience</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="margin-top: 2rem;"><em>This website is a side project I created to test my brain in a creative format. Learning to code was the most alien part, closely followed by DNS setup — with no easy troubleshooting, I had to fix errors manually. One of the coolest perks was building my own professional email address ending in <code>.com</code>, without @gmail or @outlook. It just looks cleaner.</em></p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Coding</strong> — I taught myself HTML/CSS to build this site</li>
    <li><strong>Digital independence</strong> — I now own the domain name</li>
    <li><strong>Custom email</strong> — professional and secure</li>
    <li><strong>Spam protection</strong> — set up authentication protocols (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>What is this project</h2>
    <p>I made this website as a little side project to test my brain in a creative format. Learning to code was, unsurprisingly, the most alien aspect of this process, closely followed by setting up the DNS of the server. The difficulty came as there is no easy troubleshoot for any mistakes; things just fail to work, meaning I had to find the faulty element in the code and fix it. Simultaneously I configured a custom email address, this to me was one of the coolest benefits, as I have built myself a corresponding email address that ends with .com; no @Gmail @icloud, no @outlook, that to me looks a lot more clean and professional.</p>

    <h3>Perks of this:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Learning coding</li>
      <li>Digital independence/ freedom</li>
      <li>Parked the domain name meaning nobody else can take it from me; more of a long-term move</li>
      <li>A professional looking email address that stands out from my peers</li>
      <li>Security! With better spam protection and settings that make it harder for scammers to imitate my email address; this is because I built my DNS with proper authentication protocols giving my emails a digital key that proves it came from my domain.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="Cool photo of me.jpg" alt="Morgan Hartshorn portrait with Sheffield cityscape background" />
    <p>I am a young professional going into my final year studying Business and Enterprise Management. One of my strengths, and what makes me unique, comes from my background, which gives me a different angle through which I view the world of business.</p>

    <p>We live in a world where revenues and cash flows are the ultimate indicators of success and failure. With the foundation of this success coming from understanding society and what motivates the customer to spend their hard-earned cash. Subsequent failure to effectively capitalise on these behavioural insights being the barrier preventing many SME’s from being able to develop into market leaders.</p>

    <p>Before I enrolled in my degree, I studied Psychology and Sociology. This helped equip me with a deeper insight into human behaviour, and how consumer preferences have been conditioned into people. Helping form a better understanding of how I can help capitalise on these preferences and tackle real-world business challenges.</p>

    <p>At this stage in my journey, I am working hard to develop my skillset through extra-curricular activities such as; the email marketing course that I recently passed; by beginning to learn Mandarin as a second language, with China being one of the world's largest consumer markets and largest suppliers; and most importantly networking to form connections with and learn from those with industry experience.</p>

    <h2>Experience via Learning</h2>
    <p>Development occurs through self-drive and initiative inside and outside of the classroom. Self-led learning has helped me to develop subsequent hard skills and knowledge that goes much further than my university degree.</p>

    <p><strong>Email Marketing Certification:</strong> I completed an online course on email marketing strategy. Upon graduation there is a high chance I land at an SME that might not be as up to date with e-commerce. Meaning my hard skills such as email marketing could be a strong asset for helping companies to cater to a much larger target audience.</p>

    <p><strong>Alison Diploma in Financial Accounting:</strong> This certification was a 15-hour course of which I scored 95%. The course gave me a better understanding of accounting to complement my Microsoft Excel skills. Bringing me to the point that I would be confident taking on a project where I was responsible for the accounts as part of my workload.</p>

    <p>As of writing I have just signed up to Google's Fundamentals of Digital Marketing online course. Reading the course outline showcased many useful hard skills that can be learned through the course, my future progress on this will be updated.</p>

    <p>In secondary school we had weekly Chinese lessons which I enjoyed. In my 2nd year of university, I have reignited this flame and begun to learn Chinese again. In our globalised world and with the lack of production within the UK, it is pivotal to secure strong business relations with foreign suppliers, due to their low pricing and economies of scale. The ability to communicate clearly and effectively is an asset to any company, making the ability to communicate with and conduct business with China important as they are the 2nd largest economy.</p>

    <p>These certificates for these courses can be viewed on my LinkedIn profile which is in the contact section.</p>
